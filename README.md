Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system want a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality. They call it - guess what? - 'Boris' Bikes, and they're offering a tasty sum of money.
